## A.I.M.S. Design Workflow with Stitch

### CRITICAL: Human Approval Required

**ALL designs generated by Stitch MUST be approved by the user BEFORE any code changes.**

The workflow is:

1. **Design Phase** (Stitch):
   - Use `/stitch` to generate screen designs from text descriptions
   - Generate at the correct archetype (landing, auth, chat, CRM, etc.)
   - Use the RESET UI spec colors: #F8FAFC bg, #D97706 accent, slate text
   - Show screenshots/previews to the user

2. **Approval Gate**:
   - Present the design to the user
   - Wait for explicit approval: "Yes, build this" or feedback
   - Do NOT proceed to code without approval
   - If feedback given, regenerate and re-present

3. **Code Phase** (Gemini 3.1 Pro):
   - Once approved, generate Next.js + Tailwind code matching the design
   - Use the React Components agent skill for production-ready output
   - Maintain existing backend wiring (Firebase, GCP, APIs)

4. **Verify Phase**:
   - Run `npm run build` to check for errors
   - Verify responsive at phone/tablet/desktop
   - Report any gaps
