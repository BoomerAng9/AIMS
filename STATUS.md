# Task: Update to Main & Fix UI

## Status
- [x] Merge `origin/main` (Resolved conflicts using "theirs" to prioritize upstream).
- [x] Install missing frontend dependencies.
- [ ] Verify Frontend Build (currently running).
- [ ] **Critical**: Ensure Docker configuration is optimized for VPS (not local).
- [ ] Restore/Verify Branding (A.I.M.S. / ACHEEVY identity).
- [ ] Fix UI Regressions (Fonts, Layouts).

## Next Steps
1. Validating the local build to ensure code integrity.
2. Reviewing `infra/docker-compose.yml` to ensure it aligns with VPS deployment standards.
3. Checking for any UI assets or styles that might have been overwritten during the merge.
